# Legal Productivity Plugin

An AI-powered productivity plugin for in-house legal teams, primarily designed for [Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork), Anthropic's agentic desktop application — though it also works in Claude Code. Automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance workflows, legal briefings, and templated responses -- all configurable to your organization's specific playbook and risk tolerances.

> **Disclaimer:** This plugin assists with legal workflows but does not provide legal advice. Always verify conclusions with qualified legal professionals. AI-generated analysis should be reviewed by licensed attorneys before being relied upon for legal decisions. The default playbook examples in this plugin reflect U.S. legal positions and jurisdictions (Delaware, New York, California). If you operate under different legal systems (EU, UK, Netherlands, Australia, etc.), you must customize the playbook in .claude/legal.local.md to reflect your jurisdiction's specific legal requirements, standard contract terms, and compliance obligations before relying on the plugin's analysis.

## Target Personas

- **Commercial Counsel** -- Contract negotiation, vendor management, deal support
- **Product Counsel** -- Product reviews, terms of service, privacy policies, IP matters
- **Privacy / Compliance** -- Data protection regulations, DPA reviews, data subject requests, regulatory monitoring
- **Litigation Support** -- Discovery holds, document review prep, case briefings

## Installation

```
claude plugins add knowledge-work-plugins/legal
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the plugin

```
claude plugins add knowledge-work-plugins/legal
```

### 2. Configure your playbook

Create a local settings file to define your organization's standard positions. This is where you encode your team's negotiation playbook, risk tolerances, and standard terms.

Create a `legal.local.md` file where Claude can find it:

- **Cowork**: Save it in any folder you've shared with Cowork (via the folder picker). The plugin finds it automatically.
- **Claude Code**: Save it in your project's `.claude/` directory.

## Commands

### `/review-contract` -- Contract Review Against Playbook

Review a contract against your organization's negotiation playbook. Flags deviations, generates redlines, and provides business impact analysis.

```
/review-contract
```

Accepts: file upload, URL, or pasted contract text. Will ask for context (your side, deadline, focus areas) and review clause-by-clause against your configured playbook.

### `/triage-nda` -- NDA Pre-Screening

Rapid triage of incoming NDAs against standard criteria. Categorizes as GREEN (standard approval), YELLOW (counsel review), or RED (significant issues).

```
/triage-nda
```

### `/vendor-check` -- Vendor Agreement Status

Check the status of existing agreements with a vendor across your connected systems.

```
/vendor-check [vendor name]
```

Reports on existing NDAs, MSAs, DPAs, expiration dates, and key terms.

### `/brief` -- Legal Team Briefing

Generate contextual briefings for your legal work.

```
/brief daily          # Morning brief of legal-relevant items
/brief topic [query]  # Research brief on a specific legal question
/brief incident       # Rapid brief on a developing situation
```

### `/respond` -- Generate Templated Response

Generate a response from your configured templates for common inquiry types.

```
/respond [inquiry-type]
```

Supported inquiry types include: data subject request, discovery hold, vendor question, NDA request, and custom categories you define.

3. Provide context: "We are the customer, need to close by end of quarter, focus on data protection and liability"
4. Receive clause-by-clause analysis with GREEN/YELLOW/RED flags
5. Get specific redline language for YELLOW and RED items
6. Share the analysis with your deal team

### NDA Triage

1. Sales team sends an NDA from a new prospect
2. Run `/triage-nda` and paste or upload the NDA
3. Get instant classification: GREEN (route for signature), YELLOW (specific issues to review), or RED (needs full counsel review)
4. For GREEN NDAs, approve directly; for YELLOW/RED, address flagged issues

### Daily Brief

1. Start your morning with `/brief daily`
2. Get a summary of overnight contract requests, compliance questions, upcoming deadlines, and calendar items needing legal prep
3. Prioritize your day based on urgency and deadlines

### Vendor Check

2. Run `/vendor-check Acme Corp`
3. See existing agreements, expiration dates, and key terms at a glance
4. Know immediately whether you need a new NDA or can proceed under existing terms

## MCP Integration

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md).

The plugin connects to your tools through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers:

| Category | Examples | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Chat | Slack, Teams | Team requests, notifications, triage |
| Cloud storage | Box, Egnyte | Playbooks, templates, precedents |
| Office suite | Microsoft 365 | Email, calendar, documents |
| Project tracker | Atlassian (Jira/Confluence) | Matter tracking, tasks |

See [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md) for the full list of supported integrations, including CLM, CRM, e-signature, and additional options.

Configure connections in `.mcp.json`. The plugin gracefully degrades when tools are unavailable -- it will note gaps and suggest manual checks.

## Customization

### Playbook Configuration

Your playbook is the heart of the contract review system. Define your positions in `legal.local.md`:

- **Standard positions**: Your preferred contract terms
- **Acceptable ranges**: What you can agree to without escalation
- **Escalation triggers**: Terms that require senior review or outside counsel

### Response Templates

Define templates for common inquiries. Templates support variable substitution and include built-in escalation triggers for situations that should not use a templated response.

### Risk Framework

Customize the risk assessment matrix to match your organization's risk appetite and classification scheme.
